# Notes

skaled is designed to handle 1 transaction from 1 account per block, so you have to wait till the previous transaction will be mined. So, answering your question, it's not something SDK-specific, you'll get the same results on the real SKALE Chain. 

FYI, we're working on a 'high-speed mode' that will allow users to send multiple transactions in one block. This feature is scheduled for the next major release
